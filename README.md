In this repository you will find the signed APK for the app. To utilize, simply download onto an emulator or device and run the app.


The app has different features:
1. Quic Calc:
   Features a simple calculator app that can add and subtract numbers and clear current values from the screen.
   
2. Link Collector:
   Stores links to websites that the user can click on to navigate to. The links can be edited or deleted, and new links can be added.
   
3. Find Primes:
   Uses a separate thread to run a search for prime numbers, as the prime numbers increase the value on the screen updates. The activity includes a pacifier switch to ensure that the main thread is not blocked by the additional thread looking for prime numbers.

4. Location Confirmed:
   Displays the user's latitude and longitude coordinates for their device. Also counts the total distance traveled since the activity has begun, with the ability to reset this value.
